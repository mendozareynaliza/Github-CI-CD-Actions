                    <p> Essentially, what the cat is doing is performing a scent exchange between you and itself. It has special glands on its temples and in its
                        breath, and another one located at the base of its tail. Without you realizing it, your cat has marked you with its scent from these glands. 
                        The feline fragrance is too delicate for our coarse sense of smell, but it is important for friendly members of the catâ€™s family to share 
                        scents in this way. This makes the cat feel more at home with its human companions. It is also important for the cat to track with its sense
                        of smell, and it does this with its flank, the rubbing part of its greeting. Then it sits and "tests" it with its tongue, simply by licking the fur
                        it has just rubbed so carefully against us.</p>

                    <p>First of all, it is well known that friendly physical contact with cats significantly reduces stress in their companions. 
                        The relationship between humans and cats is touching in terms of reciprocity. The cat rubs against its owner's body, and the owner
                        pets and smooths the cat's fur. When these owners are subjected to laboratory tests to measure their physiological responses, it is 
                        found that their bodily systems become markedly calmer when they pet cats. Their tension decreases, and their bodies relax. 
                        This form of feline therapy is not the product of some overly enthusiastic academic's imagination. It has been practically 
                        demonstrated in several acute cases that some mental health patients have improved remarkably after being allowed the company of 
                        domestic cats.</p>

                    <p>Cats are considered to be incredibly sensitive to sudden changes in the Earth's magnetic field. Such variations often accompany 
                        earthquakes. Perhaps the three reactions occur simultaneously: detecting minor tremors, electrostatic activity, and magnetic
                        agitation. One thing is certain: cats become increasingly agitated before major earthquakes begin. Cat owners who know how to
                        interpret their pets' fear may owe their lives to this sensitivity. In many cases, it has been observed that cats suddenly run 
                        around the house, desperate to escape.</p>
